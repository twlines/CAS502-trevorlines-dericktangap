Entrepreneurial Journey in Data

CAS 502 Team Project — Trevor Lines & Derick Tangap

Overview
This project analyzes data from entrepreneurs to understand what separates successful ventures from unsuccessful ones. We're building Python scripts to process, classify, and analyze the PSED I & II datasets.

Research Question
What patterns of activity and decision-making distinguish entrepreneurs who successfully launch ventures versus those who don’t?
Dataset
PSED I and PSED II — University of Michigan longitudinal studies tracking entrepreneurs over multiple years through phone survey interviews.
Format: Tabular data with encoded variables (requires codebook translation)
Sample questions: "Have you made your first sale?", "How many people own part of this business?"
Source: ICPSR

Planned Features
Core Functionality

Data Loader — Python module to load PSED files, handle missing values, create analysis-ready dataset

State Classifier — Rule-based system assigning ventures to stages: 
1) nascent-early
2) nascent-active 
3) launched 
4) operating 
5) profitable 
x) disengaged

Movement Calculator — Track stage transitions across survey waves

Extended Goals
Predictive model for venture success probability
Pattern identification among successful founders
Anti-pattern detection for high-risk trajectories
