To support the technical goals of the project, the following Workflow Strategy will be implemented to manage development within the GitHub repository:

### Branching ModelThe project will utilize a Feature-Branch Workflow to ensure the stability of the core scripts while allowing for iterative development.
*   `main` Branch: This branch will strictly contain production-ready code, such as the finalized scripts for decoding the PSED datasets and generating reports.
*   Feature Branches: Each core functionality outlined in the implementation plan will be developed in its own dedicated branch (e.g., `feature/data-loader`, `feature/state-sorter`, `feature/movement-calculator`). This prevents incomplete code from breaking the main analysis tool.

### Technical Integration and Review*   Role-Based Contributions: Since Derick has more coding experience, he will primarily manage the technical feature branches, while Trevor will focus on documentation, issues, and project leadership within the repository.
*   Merging Requirements: No feature branch will be merged into `main` until it meets the success criteria defined in the implementation plan, specifically passing unit tests for variable transformation and handling missing data without errors.
*   Issue Tracking: Each branch will be linked to specific GitHub Issues categorized as "Basic Functionality" (e.g., Data Loader) or "Nice-to-Have" (e.g., Success Predictor) to maintain clarity during our weekly Saturday synchronization meetings.

### Version Control Best Practices*   Commits: Each team member must perform regular commits to their respective branches to ensure transparency and version history, particularly when handling the complex encoded PSED data.
*   .gitignore: A standard Python `.gitignore` file will be maintained to prevent unnecessary files from cluttering the repository, ensuring a clean and professional codebase.
