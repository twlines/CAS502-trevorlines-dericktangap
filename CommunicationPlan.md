Communication Plan

Primary Communication Channels

Text/SMS — Quick questions and availability updates
Email — Formal communication, sharing documents, task lists
Shared Documents — Google Docs for planning, GitHub for code

Meeting Schedule

Weekly focused meetings on Saturdays to:

Synchronize our work
Finalize assignments for submission
Plan and divide tasks for the upcoming week

Trevor will prepare an agenda for each meeting to keep discussions focused and efficient.

Expectations

Respond to messages within 24 hours when possible
Flag blockers or availability issues early
Come to meetings prepared with completed tasks or clear status updates

Contingency Plan

If one team member is unavailable on a given week:

Communicate unavailability as early as possible
The available team member will complete critical deliverables
Unavailable member catches up and contributes extra the following week

Our primary strategy is open and honest communication about availability and coming prepared to assignments.
